//! Rendering an AST back into SYON text.
//!
//! The inverse of [`crate::parser`], and it lives beside it for the same reason
//! the parser has no sibling: there is one implementation of SYON's syntax
//! here, so the block-only style and the promotion rules are decided in a
//! single place. Anything that persists SYON — a task runner, a project tree,
//! a schema — calls [`emit`] rather than assembling text by hand.
//!
//! ## What it guarantees
//!
//! * **Block style only.** No flow collection is ever produced, whatever a
//!   consumer put in a scalar.
//! * **Nothing needing a non-default permission.** A sequence of mappings is
//!   written with the dash on its own line rather than as `- key: value`,
//!   because the compact form is the "key in line after list" construct this
//!   parser refuses unless asked. An emitter whose output its own parser
//!   rejects by default would be a trap.
//! * **Order is preserved.** Mapping entries and sequence items are walked in
//!   the order they are held, so re-emitting an unchanged tree is byte-identical
//!   and an edit produces a minimal diff.
//! * **Comments survive.** This parser keeps `leading_comments` and
//!   `trailing_comment` on every entry and item, so a file that goes through
//!   [`crate::parse`] and back through [`emit`] keeps the prose somebody wrote
//!   in it. That is the part a consumer cannot reconstruct, and it is why an
//!   emitter belongs here rather than in each consumer.
//! * **Literal blocks where they are needed.** A scalar that cannot be written
//!   inline without changing meaning is promoted to a `|` block, so multi-line
//!   text lands in the file as readable lines.
//!
//! ## Round-trip limits, inherent to the format
//!
//! Three, and none of them is a defect in this module:
//!
//! * **Indentation common to every line of a block is not representable.** A
//!   `|` block is dedented to its own indentation on the way in, so `"  padded"`
//!   comes back as `"padded"`. *Relative* indentation survives, which is what
//!   matters for pasted logs and numbered steps.
//! * **A scalar ending in newlines** comes back with one, or none for a
//!   single-line value.
//! * **A scalar that is exactly `|` or `>`** cannot be written as a scalar: on
//!   its own after a key, either opens a block. It is promoted, so the text
//!   survives, but it reads back as a `LiteralBlock` rather than a `Scalar`.
//! * **A key containing `:` or starting with `#`** has no spelling. Keys in
//!   practice are identifiers, so they are written verbatim rather than
//!   failing; validate keys upstream if they come from user input.
//!
//! And one that is worth stating separately, because it is about the file
//! rather than about a value:
//!
//! * **Several *unfenced* documents cannot be written back as several.** The
//!   parser produces one when a construct at the same indentation as its key
//!   turns out to be a sibling rather than a child, so a file can hold two
//!   without ever having named a fence. There is no separator to write between
//!   them — that is what a fence is for — so [`emit_file`] concatenates them
//!   and the result reads back as one. Emitting a tree that was fenced is
//!   exact; emitting one that was accidentally split is lossy, and the fix is
//!   to fence the source. [`emit_file`] cannot tell the difference, so
//!   [`is_faithful`] is what a caller checks when it matters.
